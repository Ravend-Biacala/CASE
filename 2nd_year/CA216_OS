Operating-System Operations
    -Interrupt driven (hardware and software)
    -Software interrupt (exception or trap):
        -Software error (e.g., division by zero)
        -Other process problems include infinite loop, processes modifying each other or the operating system
        
    -Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components
        -User mode and kernel mode
        -Mode bit provided by hardware
            -Provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code
            -Some instructions designated as privileged, only executable in kernel mode
            -System call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
    -Increasingly CPUs support multi-mode operations
        -i.e. virtual machine manager (VMM) mode for guest VMs
