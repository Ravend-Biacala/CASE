p(c|e)
p(e|v)

bayesian network

directon of causality

indipendany C and E

P(C), P(E)
whenever theres and arrow get the conditional prob
this means its dependant on the parent
4 possible combinations

4a
p(v|c^e)p(c)p(e)
p(v|c^-e)p(c)p(-e)
p(v|-c^e)p(-c)p(e)
p(v|-c^-e)p(-c)p(-e)

4b
i)p(V) = sum of all prop in parts a = i + ii + iii + iv
ii)p(V)andp(c) = part ii + part i 
iii)p(c|v) = p(c^v)/p(v) ii/i
iv) p(v)p(e) = i + iii
v) iv+ / i
